Project Overview

ServoSentry is a cutting-edge, mobile, computer-vision based security platform that seamlessly integrates advanced object detection with dual-mode locomotion capabilities. Designed for diverse operational environments, the system supports both wheeled and quadrupedal configurations, ensuring effective performance on smooth indoor surfaces as well as challenging, uneven outdoor terrain. The architecture is organized into two primary subsystems: an intelligent computer vision module and a versatile locomotion unit.

The computer vision component employs a high-resolution camera coupled with deep learning algorithms, including YOLOv3, to detect and classify up to twelve distinct object types with an accuracy of approximately 70%. This capability enables the system to accurately identify potential intruders and communicate critical information to a centralized monitoring station, thereby enhancing situational awareness and prompt response. Simultaneously, the locomotion subsystem is engineered to deliver adaptive movement; the wheeled system provides rapid and efficient transit on flat surfaces, while the quadrupedal system offers superior maneuverability for navigating obstacles and irregular terrains.

Central to the design is a modular carrier board that not only facilitates seamless switching between locomotion modes but also consolidates the power and signal interfaces required by both subsystems. This integrated approach enhances reliability, simplifies maintenance, and allows for future scalability, including the potential integration of additional sensors and advanced control algorithms. Overall, ServoSentry stands as a robust, high-performance security solution, delivering comprehensive area surveillance and autonomous patrol capabilities, while remaining adaptable to the evolving needs of modern robotics applications.
